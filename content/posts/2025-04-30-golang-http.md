# Level Up Your Go Web Server: Mastering Advanced Routing with `net/http`

Building robust and maintainable web applications in Go often hinges on how effectively you manage incoming HTTP requests. While Go's built-in `net/http` package provides foundational tools, its advanced routing features empower you to create sophisticated and organized application logic. This article will guide you through practical code examples for path parameters, HTTP method constraints, host-based routing, middleware, sub-routing, and context-elevating your Go web server development.

## Decoding Dynamic URLs: The Power of Path Parameters

Gone are the days of rigid URL structures. With Go 1.22+, you can define dynamic segments within your routes using braces, like `/users/{id}`. This allows you to capture variable parts of the URL as parameters.

```go
http.HandleFunc("/users/{id}", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    id := r.PathValue("id")
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "User ID: %s", id)
})
```

> **Tip:** Be mindful of route precedence. Overlapping patterns can lead to unexpected behavior, so plan your route definitions carefully.

---

## Beyond GET and POST: Specifying HTTP Methods

Restricting routes to specific HTTP methods is fundamental for building RESTful APIs. The `net/http` router allows you to define the accepted method at the beginning of your route pattern.

```go
http.HandleFunc("GET /posts/{id}", handleGetPost)
http.HandleFunc("POST /posts", handleCreatePost)

func handleGetPost(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    id := r.PathValue("id")
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Fetching post with ID: %s", id)
}

func handleCreatePost(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "Creating a new post")
}
```

> **Note:** Ensure there is a single space between the method and the path. Incorrect formatting can lead to routing failures.

## Hosting with Precision: Implementing Host-Based Routing

In scenarios where you're hosting multiple applications or subdomains on the same server, host-based routing becomes invaluable. You can define routes that are specific to certain hostnames:

```go
http.HandleFunc("GET {host}/dashboard", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    host := r.PathValue("host")
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Dashboard for host: %s", host)
})
```

This pattern matches requests like `GET example.com/dashboard` and makes the host available as a parameter.

## Enhancing Request Handling: The Elegance of Middleware

Middleware functions are the unsung heroes of web application development, allowing you to intercept and process requests before they reach your main handler. In Go, middleware takes an `http.Handler` as input and returns a new `http.Handler`.

```go
func loggingMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        log.Printf("Request: %s %s", r.Method, r.URL.Path)
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}

// Usage
http.Handle("/", loggingMiddleware(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello, world!")
})))
```

> For more advanced scenarios (like capturing the HTTP status code), you might need to implement a custom `http.ResponseWriter`.

---

## Structuring Your Application: The Benefits of Sub-Routing

As your application grows, managing all routes in a single place can become cumbersome. Sub-routing offers a solution by allowing you to divide your routing logic into multiple, distinct routers.

```go
apiRouter := http.NewServeMux()
apiRouter.HandleFunc("/posts", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "API: Posts endpoint")
})
apiRouter.HandleFunc("/users", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "API: Users endpoint")
})

mainRouter := http.NewServeMux()
mainRouter.Handle("/api/", http.StripPrefix("/api", apiRouter))

http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mainRouter)
```

This structure allows `/api/posts` and `/api/users` to be handled by `apiRouter`, keeping your code organized and maintainable.

---

## Sharing Context: Passing Data Through the Request Lifecycle

The `context` package provides a powerful mechanism for passing request-scoped data between middleware and handler functions.

```go
func authMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), "userID", "12345")
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
    })
}

http.Handle("/profile", authMiddleware(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    userID, ok := r.Context().Value("userID").(string)
    if !ok {
        http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusUnauthorized)
        return
    }
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "User ID from context: %s", userID)
})))
```

This is invaluable for tasks like authentication, authorization, or tracing request IDs.

## Putting It All Together: Example Server

Here's a minimal example combining these concepts:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func loggingMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        log.Printf("Request: %s %s", r.Method, r.URL.Path)
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}

func authMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), "userID", "12345")
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
    })
}

func main() {
    apiRouter := http.NewServeMux()
    apiRouter.HandleFunc("GET /posts/{id}", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        id := r.PathValue("id")
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "API: Post ID %s\n", id)
    })

    apiRouter.HandleFunc("POST /posts", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintln(w, "API: Create Post")
    })

    mainRouter := http.NewServeMux()
    mainRouter.Handle("/api/", http.StripPrefix("/api", loggingMiddleware(apiRouter)))
    mainRouter.Handle("/profile", authMiddleware(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        userID, _ := r.Context().Value("userID").(string)
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Profile for user: %s\n", userID)
    })))

    log.Println("Server running on :8080")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mainRouter)
}
```
