&lt;p>Flow is pretty simple, but we have a couple of components.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We need something to “receive” emails. The easiest way is to use Amazon SES or mailgun or… something else. There are a couple of SASS solutions for that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Next step is to be notified when the email arrives, so we don’t have overhead with checking email every couple of minutes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have to “decompose” – decode email from it’s raw format to text, and attachments. We can achieve that using couple of existing libraries, but you get the idea&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have to save all data and expose it to public&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So we know what to do and roughly how to do the whole process. Points 1 and 2 are pretty straightforward for anyone who uses AWS and their services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to make email work better email2issue</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2018/how-to-make-email-work-better-email2issue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2018 09:02:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2018/how-to-make-email-work-better-email2issue/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The problem:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are using a bug tracking system, like most software development companies. Creating an issue is quite simple. Open bug tracking system, fill some inputs, upload attachments – done. The issue is created. Sometimes an issue is described with multiple attachments (screenshots). A bug tracking system allows us to embed images into a description. All issues come from users in the form of an email.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
