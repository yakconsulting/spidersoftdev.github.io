&lt;p>When deploying applications on AWS App Runner, you may need to access S3 buckets to store or retrieve data. However, by default, App Runner services don&amp;rsquo;t have permission to interact with S3. This guide aims to solve that problem by walking you through the process of granting your App Runner service secure access to S3 buckets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll achieve this by:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Creating an IAM role with the necessary S3 permissions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configuring your App Runner service to use this role&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Setting up networking components (if using a VPC) to ensure connectivity&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>By following these steps, you&amp;rsquo;ll enable your App Runner service to securely read from and write to S3 buckets, allowing for seamless integration of S3 storage in your application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Restore Files from Glacier on Amazon S3 Storage using Bash Script</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2023/how-to-restore-objects-from-glacier-with-a-script/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2023/how-to-restore-objects-from-glacier-with-a-script/</guid><description>&lt;p>Amazon S3 storage is a popular cloud storage service that provides scalable object storage for data backup, archive, and disaster recovery. One of the storage options available on Amazon S3 is Amazon Glacier, which provides a low-cost, long-term storage solution for data archiving and backup. However, retrieving data from Amazon Glacier can be time-consuming and expensive. In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to restore files from Glacier on Amazon S3 storage using a Bash script.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to scrape page source with Go and chromedp</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2023/scraping-pages-with-go-and-chromedp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2023/scraping-pages-with-go-and-chromedp/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s clear what we are trying to achieve, so let&amp;rsquo;s consider the requirements. Firstly, we need a tool to render web pages since JavaScript is commonly used nowadays. Secondly, we require an API to communicate with the headless browser. Lastly, saving the result can be challenging as browsers are designed to interact with rendered results rather than directly with the source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="headless-browser">Headless browser&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So we are looking for a headless browser. We are going to use 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://github.com/chromedp/docker-headless-shell">Chrome&amp;amp;rsquo;s headless-shell&lt;/a>
 because it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use, and it&amp;rsquo;s based on 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium&lt;/a>
 . The most significant advantage is docker image, which we can efficiently run on our local machine or anywhere in the cloud.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to test golang written lambda function locally</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2022/how-to-test-lambda-function-locally/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2022/how-to-test-lambda-function-locally/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a while I was looking for an easy we to test my lambda functions written in golang locally.

SMTP protocol is bit slower, but it’s so common that you can use it everywhere. Each modern application allows you define your own SMTP server to send emails. But… we love speed, SMTP from it’s nature it’s bit slower then regular API call.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How slow is FOUND_ROWS function in MySQL</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2016/how-slow-is-found_rows-function-in-mysql/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2016 04:15:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2016/how-slow-is-found_rows-function-in-mysql/</guid><description>&lt;p>From many reasons I was always using

Not many people realise but Google Cloud Storage is

&lt;p>From time to time, you want to get fresh version of it. If you run that command again it will NOT update the library – because it’s already there. To update it you need to use the &lt;code>-u&lt;/code> switch:&lt;/p>
