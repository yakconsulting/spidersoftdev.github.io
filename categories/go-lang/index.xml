&lt;p&gt;When your Fiber application runs behind a reverse proxy like Caddy, Nginx, or Cloudflare, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that &lt;code&gt;c.IP()&lt;/code&gt; returns the proxy&amp;rsquo;s IP address instead of your actual visitor&amp;rsquo;s IP. This happens because Fiber sees the direct connection, which is from the proxy server, not the original client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-this-happens"&gt;Why This Happens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Fiber reads the IP from the direct TCP connection for security reasons. Without proper configuration, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t know there&amp;rsquo;s a trusted proxy in front of it passing along the real client information in HTTP headers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Level Up Your Go Web Server: Mastering Advanced Routing with net/http</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/posts/2025-04-30-golang-http/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 11:35:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/posts/2025-04-30-golang-http/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="level-up-your-go-web-server-mastering-advanced-routing-with-nethttp"&gt;Level Up Your Go Web Server: Mastering Advanced Routing with &lt;code&gt;net/http&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building robust and maintainable web applications in Go often hinges on how effectively you manage incoming HTTP requests. While Go&amp;rsquo;s built-in &lt;code&gt;net/http&lt;/code&gt; package provides foundational tools, its advanced routing features empower you to create sophisticated and organized application logic. This article will guide you through practical code examples for path parameters, HTTP method constraints, host-based routing, middleware, sub-routing, and context-elevating your Go web server development.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to scrape page source with Go and chromedp</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2023/scraping-pages-with-go-and-chromedp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2023/scraping-pages-with-go-and-chromedp/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clear what we are trying to achieve, so let&amp;rsquo;s consider the requirements. Firstly, we need a tool to render web pages since JavaScript is commonly used nowadays. Secondly, we require an API to communicate with the headless browser. Lastly, saving the result can be challenging as browsers are designed to interact with rendered results rather than directly with the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="headless-browser"&gt;Headless browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are looking for a headless browser. We are going to use 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://github.com/chromedp/docker-headless-shell"&gt;Chrome’s headless-shell&lt;/a&gt;
 because it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use, and it&amp;rsquo;s based on 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home"&gt;Chromium&lt;/a&gt;
 . The most significant advantage is docker image, which we can efficiently run on our local machine or anywhere in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to test golang written lambda function locally</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2022/how-to-test-lambda-function-locally/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2022/how-to-test-lambda-function-locally/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For a while I was looking for an easy we to test my lambda functions written in golang locally.

I decided to try to migrate data to DynamoDB, and this time I was successful. I will try to explain how I did it and what I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to create AWS Signature on GET POST request</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2022/aws-signature-request/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2022/aws-signature-request/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Postman, it&amp;rsquo;s a great tool for debuging, testing and other activities performed by us - developers.

I started as a sysadmin setting up servers running FreeBSD and early versions of Debian on bare-bone servers. As soon as “cloud” came into the market, I switched to AWS and GCE and have used them since then. EC2 was my always goto choice to deploy something on the internet quickly. But Docker — for some reason, I was avoiding it until this two years ago, when I started using it. Without too much trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, history is not about my love &amp;amp; hate relationship with Docker, but about deploying the GO application and VIPS library. A couple of problems appeared during the process, and it’s worth mentioning them for future generations because I could find much help around my issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why VIPS and Go it’s not a good match for production environment</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/posts/2020-07-14-vips-and-go-does-not-play-together/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 07:19:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/posts/2020-07-14-vips-and-go-does-not-play-together/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I built a simple worker to do some magic with images by using Go &amp;amp; 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://github.com/libvips/libvips"&gt;VIPS&lt;/a&gt;
 . I chose VIPS because it is 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://github.com/fawick/speedtest-resize"&gt;blazing fast&lt;/a&gt;
 compared to other Go image processing libraries. So this is the story about what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because my DEV setup is Apple MacBook Pro with M1 Apple Silicon, it’s always tricky to compile something to the proper architecture. Installing VIPS on my machine, it’s pretty straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flow is pretty simple, but we have a couple of components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need something to “receive” emails. The easiest way is to use Amazon SES or mailgun or… something else. There are a couple of SASS solutions for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next step is to be notified when the email arrives, so we don’t have overhead with checking email every couple of minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to “decompose” – decode email from it’s raw format to text, and attachments. We can achieve that using couple of existing libraries, but you get the idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to save all data and expose it to public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we know what to do and roughly how to do the whole process. Points 1 and 2 are pretty straightforward for anyone who uses AWS and their services.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to make email work better email2issue</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2018/how-to-make-email-work-better-email2issue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2018 09:02:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2018/how-to-make-email-work-better-email2issue/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idea is very simple – download page, run xpath query on it and spit out results. I was looking for decent xpath library for Go and couldn’t find any. I tried to use 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="http://gopkg.in/xmlpath.v2"&gt;xmlpath&lt;/a&gt;
