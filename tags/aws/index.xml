One of the storage options available on Amazon S3 is Amazon Glacier, which provides a low-cost, long-term storage solution for data archiving and backup. However, retrieving data from Amazon Glacier can be time-consuming and expensive. In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to restore files from Glacier on Amazon S3 storage using a Bash script.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to test golang written lambda function locally</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2022/how-to-test-lambda-function-locally/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2022/how-to-test-lambda-function-locally/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For a while I was looking for an easy we to test my lambda functions written in golang locally.

&lt;p&gt;Flow is pretty simple, but we have a couple of components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need something to “receive” emails. The easiest way is to use Amazon SES or mailgun or… something else. There are a couple of SASS solutions for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next step is to be notified when the email arrives, so we don’t have overhead with checking email every couple of minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to “decompose” – decode email from it’s raw format to text, and attachments. We can achieve that using couple of existing libraries, but you get the idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have to save all data and expose it to public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we know what to do and roughly how to do the whole process. Points 1 and 2 are pretty straightforward for anyone who uses AWS and their services.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Getting started with AWS CLI</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2017/getting-started-with-aws-cli/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2017 07:25:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2017/getting-started-with-aws-cli/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;AWS has extremely nice UI.
