&lt;p>We are using bug tracking system, as most of the software development companies. Creating an issue is quite simple. Open bug tracking system, fill some inputs, upload attachments – done. Issue is created. Sometimes issue is described with multiple attachments (screenshots). Bug tracking system allows us to embed images into description.  All issues come from users in a form of email.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
