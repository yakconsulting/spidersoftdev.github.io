I started as a sysadmin setting up servers running FreeBSD and early versions of Debian on bare-bone servers. As soon as “cloud” came into the market, I switched to AWS and GCE and have used them since then. EC2 was my always goto choice to deploy something on the internet quickly. But Docker — for some reason, I was avoiding it until this two years ago, when I started using it. Without too much trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, history is not about my love &amp;amp; hate relationship with Docker, but about deploying the GO application and VIPS library.

Of course size does matter, not only in case of women breasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was trying to convert files directly from PDF to JPEG results was pretty scary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;convert myfile.pdf[1] dc.jpg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;number 1 in brackets means only one(second) page to process.&lt;br&gt;
As I result I get file with pretty huge size: 496.8K&lt;br&gt;
but… if we do this in two steps:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
