 language. It’s pretty simple but very power full language. Learning curve is hard – because it’s pretty new language, but from the other hand it’s good – because there is a lot of freshmen questions on StackOverflow and plenty of articles .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because most of the stuff is related with REST communication with APIs core of my software works with JSON objects. In general we are looking also something for HTTP communication, uploading files and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to test and capture REST API calls</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/how-to-test-test-and-capture-rest-api-calls/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2014 03:21:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/how-to-test-test-and-capture-rest-api-calls/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Just bunch of very useful tools to help us with testing and building REST API.&lt;/p&gt;

On the beginning you always trying to do everything by your self. No frameworks, no libraries – bare bone solutions written from the scratch. Later – you realising than your time is to expensive, and start using some libraries. After another period of time you are getting to the point, that you are willing to use as many existing solutions as it’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;

 () command or using more sophisticated libraries like
