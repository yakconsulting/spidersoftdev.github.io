But not everyone knows or can use SFTP, SSH whatever to update their website. Sometimes you just need something as simple as good old FTP server on your instance. Let’s do it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Easy deployment from GIT to FTP</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2015/easy-deployment-from-git-to-ftp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 13:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2015/easy-deployment-from-git-to-ftp/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m huge fan of Continuous Integration and all possible automation which can save me any time during development process.

&lt;p>Basically each decent IDE has FTP client build in, but sometimes you don’t have access to your IDE but obviously you got your code in GIT repository. If you are using 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket&lt;/a>
 or 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://github.com">Github&lt;/a>
 you are lucky – you can use 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://github.com/rasshofer/ftploy">FTPloy&lt;/a>
  . It’s super simple service, which gives you option to bind your repository with FTP server. After change is made – it deploys your files on the server. Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
