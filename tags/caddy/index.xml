 &lt;a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy server&lt;/a>
 . I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware that it&amp;rsquo;s related to Caddy - the initial thought was that something went wrong with the SSL certificate. But I was wrong. The message was pretty &amp;ldquo;platonic&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

Personally – I love it. Same love I feel to CodeIgniter . To marge both of them, we need only basic rewrite rule to drop into caddyfile.

 &lt;a href="https://caddyserver.com">Caddy&lt;/a>
 is a another alternative to 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://httpd.apache.org">Apache&lt;/a>
 or 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="http://nginx.org">nginx&lt;/a>
 . For me the biggest advantage is that it’s only one binary file to work with. It’s easy to run, setup and just “works”. It’s super modern – handles HTTP2 and automatic HTTPS encryption using let’s encrypt certificates. Obviously it has plenty of other features but we focus only on speed of deployment.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
