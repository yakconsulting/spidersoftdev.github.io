I started as a sysadmin setting up servers running FreeBSD and early versions of Debian on bare-bone servers. As soon as “cloud” came into the market, I switched to AWS and GCE and have used them since then. EC2 was my always goto choice to deploy something on the internet quickly. But Docker — for some reason, I was avoiding it until this two years ago, when I started using it. Without too much trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, history is not about my love &amp;amp; hate relationship with Docker, but about deploying the GO application and VIPS library. A couple of problems appeared during the process, and it’s worth mentioning them for future generations because I could find much help around my issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why VIPS and Go it’s not a good match for production environment</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/posts/2020-07-14-vips-and-go-does-not-play-together/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 07:19:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/posts/2020-07-14-vips-and-go-does-not-play-together/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I built a simple worker to do some magic with images by using Go &amp;amp; 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://github.com/libvips/libvips"&gt;VIPS&lt;/a&gt;
 . I chose VIPS because it is 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://github.com/fawick/speedtest-resize"&gt;blazing fast&lt;/a&gt;
 compared to other Go image processing libraries. So this is the story about what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because my DEV setup is Apple MacBook Pro with M1 Apple Silicon, it’s always tricky to compile something to the proper architecture. Installing VIPS on my machine, it’s pretty straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew install vips&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
