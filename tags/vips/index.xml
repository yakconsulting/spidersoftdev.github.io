I chose VIPS because it is blazing fast compared to other Go image processing libraries. So this is the story about what went wrong.
Because my DEV setup is Apple MacBook Pro with M1 Apple Silicon, it’s always tricky to compile something to the proper architecture. Installing VIPS on my machine, it’s pretty straightforward:</description></item></channel></rss>
