People were using RAR to shave couple kilobytes from archives, and having 2mb executable was better then having 4mb executable file. In that beautiful time we used

The answer isn’t simple – it depends. Usually, we have couple components which are critical for the whole system. If we are talking about a web-based solution or any API we have to decide about DATABASE, then we have STORAGE, moving on – some BACKEND service language.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>TOTP security tokens and 2-Step Verification</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2015/totp-security-tokens-and-2-step-verification/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2015 05:37:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2015/totp-security-tokens-and-2-step-verification/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-based One-time Password Algorithm&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;TOTP&lt;/strong&gt;) is an algorithm that computes a

  it’s Google answer to [Amazon S3][1] service. As long one of them is very popular 😉 Second wasn’t so successful amongst developers due to quite complex processes around service. Amazon is super simple, and developer friendly – Google… well not so easy. So the questions – why you may consider using GS instead of well documented, and super easy S3. Not many people realise but Google Cloud Storage is 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="http://www.cloudberrylab.com/blog/amazon-s3-azure-and-google-cloud-prices-compare/"&gt;actually cheaper&lt;/a&gt;
 . The other reason to use Google Storage is having different provider as a backup solution. Anyway – let’s show how easy is to use GS with existing S3 libraries.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>MongoDB vs MySQL using golang</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/mongodb-vs-mysql-using-golang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2014 04:48:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/mongodb-vs-mysql-using-golang/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I’m the guy who like to test. Benchmark is my… middle name. You can find dozens articles about speed one or other solution. I mean 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="http://www.mongodb.org/"&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;
 and 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="http://www.mysql.com/"&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;
 . I tried MongoDB couple times, and each time I wasn’t  moved by it speed. Got project coming in, when I have to deal with large amount of concurrent connection. It’s not very big, but bigger then casual MySQL load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… how did I test – very dump way. Got 2 tables, one around 11k records, second one close to 200k record. Not much. Fields were indexed in both MySQL and MongoDB. And then i run benchmarks. First one had string fields, second one numeric.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reading unknown JSON object in go language</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/reading-unknown-json-object-in-go-language/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2014 07:19:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/reading-unknown-json-object-in-go-language/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Exploring [The Go Language][1] is so much fun.

 &lt;a href="http://golang.org/"&gt;The Go Programming Language&lt;/a&gt;
 – so far I loved it. I figure out that I’ll push some code snippets from time to time.&lt;br&gt;
Today I spend some time creating simple not ever crawler, but website fetcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idea is very simple – download page, run xpath query on it and spit out results. I was looking for decent xpath library for Go and couldn’t find any. I tried to use 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="http://gopkg.in/xmlpath.v2"&gt;xmlpath&lt;/a&gt;
 but it sucks. I couldn’t even run queries like &lt;code&gt;id('product-details')/div[@class='product-price']&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; Then I found something nicer – 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://github.com/moovweb/gokogiri"&gt;Gokogiri&lt;/a&gt;
 – which works pretty nicely, but – couldn’t find any examples except this 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://www.moovweb.com/blog/gokogiri-the-best-way-to-parse-xml-in-go/"&gt;small article&lt;/a&gt;
 .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem with running Gokogiri is that it uses &lt;code&gt;libxml2&lt;/code&gt; which is not a huge problem on Linux based systems, but on Mac OS X you have to install it via 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="http://brew.sh/"&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;brew install libxml2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
