People were using RAR to shave couple kilobytes from archives, and having 2mb executable was better then having 4mb executable file. In that beautiful time we used UPX – I wasn’t aware that this project is still alive, and works nicely with binaries create bo go lang.

The answer isn’t simple – it depends. Usually, we have couple components which are critical for the whole system. If we are talking about a web-based solution or any API we have to decide about DATABASE, then we have STORAGE, moving on – some BACKEND service language.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TOTP security tokens and 2-Step Verification</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2015/totp-security-tokens-and-2-step-verification/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2015 05:37:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2015/totp-security-tokens-and-2-step-verification/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time-based One-time Password Algorithm&lt;/strong> (&lt;strong>TOTP&lt;/strong>) is an algorithm that computes a

  it’s Google answer to [Amazon S3][1] service. As long one of them is very popular 😉 Second wasn’t so successful amongst developers due to quite complex processes around service. Amazon is super simple, and developer friendly – Google… well not so easy. So the questions – why you may consider using GS instead of well documented, and super easy S3. Not many people realise but Google Cloud Storage is 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="http://www.cloudberrylab.com/blog/amazon-s3-azure-and-google-cloud-prices-compare/">actually cheaper&lt;/a>
 . The other reason to use Google Storage is having different provider as a backup solution. Anyway – let’s show how easy is to use GS with existing S3 libraries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MongoDB vs MySQL using golang</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/mongodb-vs-mysql-using-golang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2014 04:48:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/mongodb-vs-mysql-using-golang/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m the guy who like to test.

&lt;p>So… how did I test – very dump way. Got 2 tables, one around 11k records, second one close to 200k record. Not much. Fields were indexed in both MySQL and MongoDB. And then i run benchmarks. First one had string fields, second one numeric.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Live code reload in golang</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/live-code-reload-in-golang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2014 04:46:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2014/live-code-reload-in-golang/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recompiling

 &lt;a href="http://golang.org/">The Go Programming Language&lt;/a>
 – so far I loved it. I figure out that I’ll push some code snippets from time to time.&lt;br>
Today I spend some time creating simple not ever crawler, but website fetcher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Idea is very simple – download page, run xpath query on it and spit out results. I was looking for decent xpath library for Go and couldn’t find any. I tried to use 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="http://gopkg.in/xmlpath.v2">xmlpath&lt;/a>
 but it sucks. I couldn’t even run queries like &lt;code>id('product-details')/div[@class='product-price']&amp;quot;&lt;/code> Then I found something nicer – 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://github.com/moovweb/gokogiri">Gokogiri&lt;/a>
 – which works pretty nicely, but – couldn’t find any examples except this 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="https://www.moovweb.com/blog/gokogiri-the-best-way-to-parse-xml-in-go/">small article&lt;/a>
 .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only problem with running Gokogiri is that it uses &lt;code>libxml2&lt;/code> which is not a huge problem on Linux based systems, but on Mac OS X you have to install it via 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew&lt;/a>
 &lt;br>
&lt;code>brew install libxml2&lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
