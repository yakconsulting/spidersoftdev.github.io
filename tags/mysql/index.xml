I don&amp;rsquo;t want to install MySQL on my machine, so I decided to use Docker.

The answer isn’t simple – it depends. Usually, we have couple components which are critical for the whole system. If we are talking about a web-based solution or any API we have to decide about DATABASE, then we have STORAGE, moving on – some BACKEND service language.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How slow is FOUND_ROWS function in MySQL</title><link>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2016/how-slow-is-found_rows-function-in-mysql/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2016 04:15:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spidersoft.com.au/2016/how-slow-is-found_rows-function-in-mysql/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;From many reasons I was always using

 to get total number of records, when I was running limited query. Never especially thought about it, until i had some super performance issues with one of my projects. Obviously after quick profiling and googling  i found

 . I tried MongoDB couple times, and each time I wasn’t  moved by it speed. Got project coming in, when I have to deal with large amount of concurrent connection. It’s not very big, but bigger then casual MySQL load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… how did I test – very dump way. Got 2 tables, one around 11k records, second one close to 200k record. Not much. Fields were indexed in both MySQL and MongoDB. And then i run benchmarks.
